<!-- JSON, which stands for JavaScript Object Notation, is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is primarily used to transmit data between a server and a web application as an alternative to XML.

Key Features of JSON:
Syntax: JSON is based on a subset of JavaScript syntax, which makes it familiar and easy to use in JavaScript environments. However, it can be used with many programming languages.
Structure: JSON data is represented in key-value pairs. The keys are strings, and the values can be strings, numbers, arrays, booleans, objects, or null. -->
